# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

One of the biggest challenges for banks is not just attracting customers, but keeping them. For example, I personally have about seven accounts but actively run only two â€” and
 that decision, like many others, reflects customer behavior worth analyzing.

In this project, I explored retention and churn patterns to uncover how many customers have left based on age, balance, geography, tenure, credit score, estimated salary, and 
other key factors â€” as well as what drives them to leave.

The report further breaks down churn across gender, age ranges, account balance, and credit scores, highlighting the customer segments with the highest churn rates. These insights
 are critical for building smarter retention strategies and delivering more personalized customer experiences.
